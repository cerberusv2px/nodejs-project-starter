## Setup

Make a copy of `.env.example` as `.env` and update your application details and database credentials. Now, run the migrations and seed the database.

    $ yarn migrate
    $ yarn seed

Finally, start the application.

    $ yarn start


## Creating new Migrations and Seeds

These are the commands to create a new migration and corresponding seed file.

    $ yarn make:migration <name>
    $ yarn make:seeder <name>

Example,

    $ yarn make:migration create_tags_table
    $ yarn make:seeder 02_insert_tags
